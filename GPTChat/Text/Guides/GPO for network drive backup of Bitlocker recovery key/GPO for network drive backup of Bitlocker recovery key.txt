To create a GPO that automatically runs a script at logon that attempts to take a backup of the Bitlocker recovery key to a network drive, follow these steps:

Open the Group Policy Management Console on your domain controller.

Right-click on the domain or organizational unit where you want to apply the GPO and select "Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here..."

Give the GPO a name, such as "Bitlocker Recovery Key Backup".

Right-click on the newly created GPO and select "Edit".

In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to Computer Configuration > Policies > Windows Settings > Scripts (Startup/Shutdown).

In the right pane, double-click on "Startup" to open the Startup Properties dialog box.

Click on the "Add" button and browse to the script that will take the Bitlocker recovery key backup.

In the script, include the command to take the backup of the Bitlocker recovery key using the hostname as the filename. For example, the command might look like this:

"manage-bde -protectors -get c: | Out-File K:\Backup\Bitlocker\Recovery keys$env:computername.txt"

Click "OK" to save the script and close the Startup Properties dialog box.

Close the Group Policy Management Editor and link the GPO to the appropriate organizational unit or domain.

Once the GPO has been applied, the script will automatically run at logon and attempt to take a backup of the Bitlocker recovery key to the specified network drive using the hostname as the filename.
