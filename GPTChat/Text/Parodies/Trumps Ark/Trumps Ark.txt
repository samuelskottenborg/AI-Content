Please rewrite the story of Noah's ark with dialogue, but Noah was actually Donald Trump
Once upon a time, there was a man named Donald Trump who was chosen by God to build an ark because a great flood was coming.

Donald Trump: "I am the chosen one, sent by God to build this ark and save all the animals. Nobody can do it better than me, believe me."

Trump's workers: "But Mr. Trump, we don't know how to build an ark. We're just construction workers."

Donald Trump: "Fake news! I'll show you how it's done. We'll make the ark great again. We'll build the biggest, strongest ark the world has ever seen."

The workers began to build the ark according to Trump's instructions, using the best materials and the most advanced technology.

As the flood waters rose, animals of all kinds began to arrive at the ark, two by two.

Donald Trump: "Look at all these animals. I am a genius. I knew I could do it."

But as the ark began to fill up, a problem arose.

Donald Trump: "We don't have enough room for all the animals. We'll have to make a list of who gets on the ark and who doesn't."

Trump's workers: "But Mr. Trump, that's not fair. Some of these animals are endangered. They'll die if they don't get on the ark."

Donald Trump: "I'm sorry, but we have to prioritize. We can't let just anyone on the ark. It's every animal for themselves."

In the end, only the strongest and most loyal animals were able to board the ark and survive the flood.

Donald Trump: "I told you I could do it. I am the best at building arks. Nobody can do it better than me."

And with that, the ark set sail on the raging waters, with Donald Trump at the helm, ready to face whatever challenges came their way.

As the days passed, the animals on the ark grew restless. They were cramped and uncomfortable, and many of them were getting sick.

Donald Trump: "Don't worry, folks. We're making great progress. We'll be out of this storm soon enough."

But the storm raged on, and the ark began to take on water.

Donald Trump: "I knew this would happen. I told them we needed a bigger ark, but nobody listened to me. We're all going to drown!"

The animals panicked and began to fight with each other.

Donald Trump: "Quiet down! This is all fake news. I can fix this. I'll just tweet about it and the storm will go away."

But no matter how many tweets he sent, the storm only grew worse.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the storm began to subside. The waters receded and the ark came to rest on a mountaintop.

Donald Trump: "I told you I could do it. I am the greatest ark builder of all time. Nobody can do it better than me."

The animals were relieved to have survived, but they were also grateful that the ordeal was over. They vowed never to trust Donald Trump again, and to always listen to the advice of experts in the future.

How did Trump react? Please finish the story in a few lines.
Despite the animals' lack of trust in him, Donald Trump remained proud of his accomplishment. He boasted about it to anyone who would listen, claiming that he had single-handedly saved all the animals on the ark.

However, as time went on and the animals began to rebuild their homes and communities, they realized that they didn't need Trump's help anymore. They had survived the flood thanks to their own strength and resilience, and they didn't need him to make their world great again.

In the end, Trump was left alone on the mountaintop, still boasting about his supposed greatness, but with no one left to listen.
