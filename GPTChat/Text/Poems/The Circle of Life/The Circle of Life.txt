Life begins with a fragile breath
A tiny spark of potential and growth
A world of possibilities ahead
A journey just beginning to unfold

As time passes and days turn to years
We learn and grow, shedding childish fears
Exploring the world with eager eyes
Discovering new wonders and surprise

We reach for our dreams and work hard to achieve
Fulfilling our goals and finding our reprieve
But just as the flowers bloom and fade
So too does our time on this Earth start to wane

The once-firm ground beneath our feet
Begins to shift and life's pace speeds
The moments we once took for granted
Now slip through our fingers, time unenhanced

And so we come full circle at last
Back to the brink of our very first breath
But with wisdom and memories to hold
We face death with grace, and our journey is told.
