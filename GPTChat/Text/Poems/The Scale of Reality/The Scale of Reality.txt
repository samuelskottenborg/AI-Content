The scale of reality is vast and grand,
From quarks so small, to the universe at hand.

At the smallest scale, there's the quark,
So tiny and hard, it's a cosmic mark.

But even these bits of matter so small,
Combine and form atoms, the building blocks of all.

Atoms join together to make molecules bright,
The building blocks of everything in sight.

Molecules combine to form all that we see,
From plants and animals, to the stars and the sea.

The universe itself is a marvel to behold,
With galaxies and nebulas, so vast and so bold.

From the smallest of scales, to the largest of all,
The beauty of reality is there for us to enthrall.

So let us marvel at the world around,
And the scale of reality, without a sound.
